Zee is a modern editor for the terminal, written in Rust. It is highly experimental code.

In the old tradition of text editor demos, here's what it currently looks like editing its own source code

![Peek 2020-03-09 00-16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/797170/76173969-0bdc4980-619c-11ea-9f24-7899e2722910.gif)

## getting started

The recommended way to install zee using cargo install
```
$ cargo install zee
```

## features

 - The 100 FPS editor. Cursor movement and edits render under 10ms. Everything else happens asynchronously (syntax parsing and highlighting, IO to/from disk, file pickers).
 - Buffers are backed by a fast B-tree implementation of a [rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)) (via cessen's [ropey](https://github.com/cessen/ropey)).
 - Uses [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for generating a parse tree from your code. This AST is used for syntax highlighting and on the fly validation. As it is an incremental parsing library, it scales to files with 1 million lines of code.
 - multi-buffer, multi-pane -- shared state *beats* tmux with multiple editors
 - fast recursive file search with fuzzy matching and aware of *ignore* files (using BurntSushi's ripgrep crates [walkdir](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir), [ignore](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep))
 - local file picker with directory navigation
 - a pragmatic editor, not a research endeavour into CRDTs

## building from source

The editor depends on a bunch of tree sitter parsers, one for each supported language. These are included as git submodules in `grammar/languages/tree-sitter-*`.
After cloning the repository, you have to run
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
then you should be able to build normally with cargo.

## usage

To start the editor run `zee`. As expected, you can pass in one or multiple files to be opened, e.g. `zee file1 file2`.

Zee uses Emacs-y keybindings. Below, `C-` means `Ctrl` + the specified key, e.g. `C-k` is `Ctrl + k`. Similarly `A-` means `Alt` + the specified key. Empty spaces denote a sequence of key presses, e.g. `C-x C-c` means first pressing `C-x` followed by `C-c`.

The following keybindings are available:

#### movement

 - `C-p`, `Up` move up
 - `C-n`, `Down` move down
 - `C-b`, `Left` move backwards
 - `C-f`, `Right` move forwards
 - `C-a`, `Home` move to start of line
 - `C-e`, `End` move to end of line
 - `C-v`, `PageDown` move down one page
 - `A-v`, `PageUp` move up one page
 - `A-<` move to the beginning of the buffer
 - `A->` move to the end of the buffer
 - `C-l` centre the cursor visually

#### editing
 - `C-d` delete forwards
 - `Backspace` delete backwards
 - `C-k` delete the current line
 - `C-SPC` enter selection mode at the current cursor position
 - `C-w` cut selection
 - `A-w` copy selection
 - `C-x h` select the entire buffer and move the cursor to the beginning
 - `C-y` paste selection (yank in Emacs)
 - `C-g` clear the current selection
 - `C-z`, `C-/` undo
 - `C-x C-s` save the current buffer

#### file navigation
 - `C-x C-f` choose a file to open using a directory-level picker
 - `C-x C-v` search recursively for a file to open from the selected directory
 - `C-l` while opening a file, go to the parent directory
 - `Tab` while opening a file, fills in the currently selected path

#### global
 - `C-g` cancel the current operation
 - `C-x 0` close the current buffer
 - `C-x o`, `C-x C-o` switch focus to the next buffer
 - `C-x C-c` quit
 - `C-t` cycle through the available themes
